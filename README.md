# Drone_Detecton_YOLOv7

1) **Drone Detection:**
  This project is on Drone detection using the Yolov7 model.
  
  The code file in ipynb format can be found at the following [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14nUQls3w6fYLnxioCTzFTJ7jZQ2cnz3V?usp=sharing).
  
  The orignal dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle, and can be found at the following [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dasmehdixtr/drone-dataset-uav).
  
  The dataset has been structured for Yolov7 object detection by splitting into 60% train, 20% validation, and 20% test sets. The original dataset contained 1359 images and after splitting they had - train set: 815 images, valid set: 272 images, test set: 272 images. The modified dataset can be found at thee following [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m3ntWup5C0d49_doH9aaxvqv-DcaPCVX?usp=sharing).
  
  The Yolov7 model has been run for 150 epochs and evaluated using the metrics: mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95. 
  
  Remarks: Performance should improve by training for more epochs.


2) **Drone Vs Bird Detection**
   
  This is an experimental project on Drone Vs Bird Detection using the Yolov7 model. The original dataset size has been reduced significantly and hence the performance is not the best. However, the code works fine.
  
  The orginal dataset is from the following [Link](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/6ghdz52pd7/5).
